# Stripe pay per generation or 1 time payment starter.

This is a NextJS starter template for those building apps wanting to bill based on number of generations instead of subscription.
It was created with 'create-t3-app'.

Make sure to setup your env variables.

Is ready to go with Google login.
For database we used supabase but that is up to you.

You can configure the number of free generations before triggering the payment option and the number of payd generations all in the .env file.

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.
